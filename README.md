   I have completed my first project - *Creating a Number Guessing Game*. You can look at the code in the respective folder of this repo. 
   
   # Things that I have mastered by making this project :
      1. I have learnt and explored a lot of stuff about PRNGs (Pseudo Random Number Generators).
      2. I used C++ STL in making it possible for seeding the number. 
      3. Using srand() and rand() - 
         The srand() function performs pseudo-random number calculations. It requires a seed value, which is used to calculate random numbers. srand() then sets up the rand() function to generate pseudo-random 
         numbers.
      4. Please go through the program to know more about this project task.
