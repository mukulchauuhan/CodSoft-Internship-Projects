# CodSoft-Internship-projects
Well, this repository will take you to the projects that I have created and completed during my one month internship at CodSoft. Hope you'll like them.

These are my projects list that I had been given during my internship journey.
               1. Creating a Number Guessing Game.
               2. Creating a simple Calculator.
               3. Creating a program to manage Student's grading system.
               4. Developing a program that counts the number of words in a given text file.
               5. Creating a Movie Ticket Booking system.

   I have completed my first project - *Creating a Number Guessing Game*. You can look at the code in the respective folder of this repo. 
   # Things that I have mastered by making this project :
      1. I have learnt and explored a lot of stuff about PRNGs (Pseudo Random Number Generators).
      2. I used C++ STL in making it possible for seeding the number. 
      3. Using srand() and rand() - 
         The srand() function performs pseudo-random number calculations. It requires a seed value, which is used to calculate random numbers. srand() then sets up the rand() function to generate pseudo-random 
         numbers.
      4. Please go through the program to know more about this project task.

To learn github well, there are a lot of small and unneccessary updates that I'm making and I think it's ok because these will help me master VCS(version control system) to a good extent. Thankyou for reading this short message :)

   I have completed my second project - *Creating a Simple Calculator in C++*
   # Things that I have learnt by doing this project : 
      1. I have learnt about vectors
      2. Handling the operations in the Switch case
      3. Taking input from the users 
      4. .push_back : push_back is a member function of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) containers like vector, deque, list, etc., which allows you to add a new element to the end of the container, 
         effectively increasing its size by one.

In version control system : I learnt that we should not add .exe file in our repository. Instead a good way is to provide the instruction to the contributors on how they can access and run the file on their computers locally.

INSTRUCTIONS

For Unix/Linux/macOS:
Compile the Program:
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your C++ file (your_program_name.cpp). Compile the program using the following command:

Copy code
g++ -o your_program your_program_name.cpp
Replace your_program_name.cpp with the actual name of your C++ file. This will create an executable named your_program.

Run the Program:
Execute the program by running the following command in the terminal:

bash
Copy code
./your_program
For Windows:
Compile the Program:
Open Command Prompt and navigate to the directory containing your C++ file (your_program_name.cpp). Compile the program using the following command:

Copy code
g++ -o your_program.exe your_program_name.cpp
Replace your_program_name.cpp with the actual name of your C++ file. This will create an executable named your_program.exe.

Run the Program:
Execute the program by running the following command in Command Prompt:

Copy code
your_program.exe

NOTE : *Make sure you have a C++ compiler like GCC installed on your system to follow these instructions*.
